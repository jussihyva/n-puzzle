# N-puzzle

N-Puzzle is a project at Hive (Helsinki) coding school.

## 1. Project description

### 1.1 A goal of the project

The goal of this project is to solve the N-puzzle game using the A\* search algorithm or one of its variants.
You start with a square board made up of N*N cells. One of these cells will be empty,
the others will contain numbers, starting from 1, that will be unique in this instance of
the puzzle.
Your search algorithm will have to find a valid sequence of moves in order to reach the
final state, a.k.a the "snail solution", which depends on the size of the puzzle (Example
below). While there will be no direct evaluation of its performance in this instance of the
project, it has to have at least a vaguely reasonable perfomance : Taking a few second to
solve a 3-puzzle is pushing it, ten seconds is unacceptable.

The only move one can do in the N-puzzle is to swap the empty cell with one of its
neighbors (No diagonals, of course. Imagine youâ€™re sliding a block with a number on it
towards an empty space).

### 2.2 Implemented search algorithms

| Based on | Algorithm name | Abbreviation| Description | Refer to |
| :- | :- | :-: | :- | - |
|**DFS**|
|| DFS Random | dfs_1 | Depth-first search (DFS) with random selection of next move ||
|| DFS Deeping | dfs_2 | Depth-first search (DFS). Depth is increased step by step until solution of a puzzle is reached ||
|| DFS Deeping mem | dfs_3 | Depth-first search (DFS). Like dfs_2, but all N-puzzle states are saved which avoid tile moves already verified direction ||
|**BFS**|
|*Linked list*| BFS List | bfs_1 | Breadth-first search (BFS) with all visited N-puzzle states are saved in a linked list ||

| **IDA*** | IDA* with a heuristic algorithm | ida | IDA* based a search with a heuristic algorithm and path cost priorize tile moves. | [Iterative deepening A*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_A*) |
| **Uniform-cost search** | UCS | ucs | Selection of the next move is based on a cost from an initial (root) state. A lowest value is the first in a priority queue. | [What is uniform-cost search?](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-uniform-cost-search) |
| **Greedy search** |  | g | Greedy is based a search with a heuristic algorithm (only) priorize tile moves. Taxicab is a default algorithm (the param -H) | |

### 2.3 Implemented heuristic algorihms

| Algorithm | Abbreviation| Description | Refer to |
| :- | :-: | :- | -|
|**Hamming distance** (Tiles out of place) |h| Selcection of the next move is based a number of tiles out of the right place. A lowest value is the first in a priority queue. | [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) |
| **Taxicab geometry** (Manhattan distance) | t | Selection of the next move is based a sum of tiles absolute distances (cartesian distance) from the right place. A lowest value is the first in a priority queue. | [Taxicab geometry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) |
| **Taxicab geometry with direct reversal of tiles penalty** | tr | Selection of the next move is based to taxicab geometry and direct reversal of tiles. A lowest value is the first in a priority queue. | [Taxicab geometry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry)|
